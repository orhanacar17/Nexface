## Example Workflows

### Batch Face Swapping

For batch processing, simply select a folder containing multiple target images or videos. NexFace will automatically process each file and apply the selected source face.

### Video Face Swapping

If you want to swap faces in a video, choose a single video file. The application will handle the face swapping frame by frame, ensuring that the audio remains intact.
